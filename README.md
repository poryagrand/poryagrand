### Wellcome 👋

I'm Porya. a small developer that started his progrmming life at the end of the highschool with creating template for wordpress as a freelancer; and continuesly worked on html and css.

at start of university alongside learning `C` and `C++`, started to learn and develope `javascript` and time to time i worked on it, i just loved more JS. i do works with some languages for my university projects and bussines projects like `PHP`, `C#` , `ASP WebForm` , `ASP MVC`, `Unity 3d` and etc. 

between this languages i more love 🤩 `C++` , `PHP` and `JavaScript` and ofcourse it is because of my love to the `C` base languages 😉 . i like to work more on assembly cause it is fantastic world.
generally it seems to me that i like to be a fullstack developer. just cause i love to learn every thing... even in chemistry , history , physics . science is love , but not its exams 😁 😆 😅
